Note: I received the following clarification from the City Attorney's office on departments (listed in Campaign & Governmental Conduct Code Section 3.1-103(b)(1)):
- The Finance Corporation - not technically city department
- Local Agency Formation Commission - not technically City Departments
- Golden Gate Park Concourse Authority is disbanding as required by November 2022â€™s Proposition N.

Note: The department head list in Campaign & Governmental Conduct Code Section 3.1-103(b)(1) appears to have a duplication
- Department of Early Childhood, Executive Director
- Early Childhood, Director
- The department list removes this duplicate, will update pending response from City Attorney's office
